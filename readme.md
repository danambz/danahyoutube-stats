# Raspberry Pi Project
## YouTube Subscriber Notifier
### Student No: 

#### Introduction
This project consists of a Raspberry Pi model which will make a beep sound every time a user subscribes to the channel on YouTube. As nowadays it is common to get notified for everything, this model is very helpful for the startup companies who want to spread the objective of their company to the mass population and have to get notified whether the user is subscribing to their YouTube channel or not. Even for the new Youtubers also this model is helpful. 
The main motivation for building this model is to create a real model which will be useful and be helpful for the day-to-day life of the user and to create something that exists in real life rather than just an app. The idea for this project is to make Raspberry Pi get connected with a speaker by the audio jack socket and to make a beep sound every time the user subscribes to the channel on YouTube.

#### Physical Construction
The model consists of the Raspberry Pi, Speaker and aux cable.

#### Code


#### Idea's for Version 2
This model has run successfully and now that the speaker beeps every time a user subscribes, it is possible to have it do more things with ease. There can be a digital LED display to show the number of users who subscribed to the channel in the further versions. We can also implement the total number of subscribers in the given time and when another user subscribes, the speaker will make the sound and the digital LED display will display the total number of subscribers subscribed for the channel. We can also make Raspberry Pi blink LED for a particular time when the user subscribes to the channel. The difficult part is already completed and other features can be added easily.

#### Conclusion
The project has worked successfully. Whenever a new user subscribes to the channel on YouTube, the speaker makes sound successfully. The unseen things in the project were the work needed to make Raspberry Pi work and get the data from the API. Connecting the API and getting the data was time-consuming, and now that it is done the project can be expanded just by updating code.
